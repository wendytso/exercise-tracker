## ü§î Inspiration 

We are often encouraged to stay active, sit less, and move more. In short, increase physical activity! It's not surprising why - physical activity has many immediate and long-term benefits. Research constantly proves that physical activity can aid in improving brain health/cognition, reducing depression and anxiety, managing one's weight and reducing the development of certain diseases (I.e., cardiovascular disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers).

At minimum, the CDC recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity a week, encouraging unique ways to incorporate physical activity into our daily lives to reach this benchmark.

Unfortunately, in 2022, the World Health Organization reported that nearly 31% of adults worldwide - approximating to a whopping 1.8 billion individuals - "did not meet the recommended levels of physical activity". While it is a common phenomenon to put health and fitness on the backburner in favour of other pressing priorities, these findings implicate a worrying, increasing trend, with projected numbers of physical inactivity to skyrocket to 35% by 2030.

Given these concerns, we were inspired to create a health and fitness application to achieve the following:

1) Build up fitness habits incrementally, transforming them into a long-term lifestyle choice, 
2) Improve overall user participation in physical activity through various activities of their choosing, 
3) Foster an online community between users and their friends to compete and positively encourage each other to exercise!

Hence, let us introduce <Input Name Here> - a web-based application that allows users to build up their fitness habits through 15, 30, 45 and one-hour increments, blending together AI-generated responses on creative ways on how to make physical activity fun and motivating.

## üíª What it does

<Input Name Here> was built using React, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to select from various physical activities, including long-distance running, basketball, skiing, and more. As consistent engagement in physical activity requires patience, diligence and continued efforts, we offer users the opportunity to engage in activities of their choice in 15, 30, 45 and 1-hour increments.

It allows users to track their accumulated progress, engaging with their community in a friendly, positive competition.

The leaderboard feature aims to help users stay motivated by assessing their progress with their fellow peers. FitBot, our trusty, friendly AI chatbot, is prompted to offer innovative, creative workout suggestions to add diversity and creativity to physical activity.

## üë• How we built it 

<Input Name Here> was built using React, a component-based library. React was our primary choice, due to its dynamic capabilities of handling design, styling and easy rendering of components. We also preferred using React due to its capabilities of faster development with live updates through React's local server.

We also used CSS to incorporate aesthetics into our project.

To add a special functionality to our project (and with a lot of mentor assistance and help!), we included our AI chatbot, FitBot, as a friendly virtual assistant to our users. FitBot was also built utilizing Groq's AI capabilities and the LLM API to provide users with tailored workout advice and solutions.

## üìÑ Challenges we ran into 

1.  For some of our members, it was our first exposure and usage of React. Learning this was fairly difficult, given the time crunch set by cmd-f!

2.  Adding onto the complexity of React, some members experienced Git pull, push and package installation difficulties.

Feel free to elaborate more here for designers

3.  Implementing the AI chatbot was completely new territory for our members. Troubleshooting was required to properly understand the code, and ensure that proper responses were being generated. To our surprise, the code for FitBot wasn't lengthy at all.

## üèÖ Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud that our team upheld the core values of cmd-f. Our team was comprised of diverse individuals of all levels and various backgrounds. Despite the difficulties that we experienced during the hackathon, all members brought new perspectives, opinions, and ideas on how to make the execution of a successful one. We all assisted one another in technical challenges encountered, and cultivated a safe team environment.

We created a web-based application that we believe strongly promotes well-being and overall health. Aesthetically, it is pleasing to the eye, balancing cuteness with functionality.

## üè´ What we learned

For some of our members, cmd-f was their first hackathon. For others, it may have been their second or third - however, the plethora of technical skills that were learnt during this hackathon were enormous (I.e., React, making API calls).

Most importantly, however, we understood the crucial importance of effective communication skills, and cultivating a team culture of mutual support and positivity. Through proper and open communication channels, we were able to be upfront and honest regarding each others' technical experience, and set clear expectations and guidelines for benchmarks to be accomplished during the hackathon. By fostering an environment of respect, patience and continued support, our members were able to deliver the project with success.

Anything else to add, please feel free!

## What's next for Work-In-Progress

There are a lot of functionalities that we hope to add to expand the capabilities of ! To further tailor to the user experience, we hope to give the user the option to set personalized workout times, rather than the 15-minute timeblocks set on the application. Is that something we hope to do? I'm not sure - just something that came to mind

We also have hopes of expanding the types of exercise and physical activity that the user can track. This can likely be achieved through the proper incorporation of an exercise-based API that supports additional activities of the users' choosing.

Finally, we also hope to implement a proper social network for the user to add or follow mutual friends. Using a larger-scale real-time database, and other advanced tools to show users friend activity through feeds (similar to that of Facebook), it would help in making fitness tracking more interactive. These are enhancements that we are excited to implement in the near future!
